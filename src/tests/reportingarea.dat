08/01/19|08/01/19||EDT|0|F|Y|Ann Arbor|MI|42.2754|-83.7308|OZONE||Moderate|No|FORECAST SUMMARY: Monday, July 29th, 2019 through Friday, August 2nd, 2019  Ozone: 8-hour Ozone concentrations will be mostly Good through mid-week, then a mix of Good and Moderates are expected.  PM-2.5: 24-hour Fine Particulate concentrations will range from Good to low-Moderate.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  A cold front passing Monday will bring showers and/or storms. High pressure then moves in Tuesday and forecast models have this high positioned over the Great Lakes region through the end of the week. A small chance for precipitation lingers Tuesday mostly in the east, otherwise, dry conditions, seasonable temperatures, and low humidity’s can be expected.  Clouds and precipitation will keep Ozone Good Monday. Good levels continue Tuesday into Wednesday thanks to northwesterly winds and cooler surface and upper level temperatures. Temperatures will warm at the surface each day past mid-week, but upper level readings remain low through Friday. Ozone could reach Moderate in a few locations, but mostly Good levels should continue.  Fine particulate could also see slow increases starting Thursday, but readings higher than low-Moderate are not anticipated.  EXTENDED FORECAST:  Extended models keep high pressure over the region through early next week. Remaining under the same airmass for a few days could be a set up for increased pollution. At this time readings higher than Moderate are not expected, but this forecast will be updated Friday to better detail air quality conditions through early next week.

At this time readings higher than Moderate are not expected, but this forecast will be updated Friday to better detail air quality conditions through early next week.

Therefore there will be a break in the local storm activity over the next few days. The trough poses no impact to the local area as it will weaken and eventually the Monsoon high pressure will migrate westward and build over the area. The afternoon high temperatures will be on the rise and approach 110 degrees by the end of the weekend/early next week.  The ozone levels are forecast to approach and exceed the health standard today and again on Friday due to the favorable conditions for ozone formation (abundant sunshine, hot afternoon temperatures and light winds). Therefore today’s ozone high pollution advisory has been extended into Friday.

08/01/19|08/01/19||EDT|0|F|Y|Benton Harbor|MI|42.1167|-86.4542|OZONE||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY: Monday, July 29th, 2019 through Friday, August 2nd, 2019  Ozone: 8-hour Ozone concentrations will be mostly Good through mid-week, then a mix of Good and Moderates are expected.  PM-2.5: 24-hour Fine Particulate concentrations will range from Good to low-Moderate.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  A cold front passing Monday will bring showers and/or storms. High pressure then moves in Tuesday and forecast models have this high positioned over the Great Lakes region through the end of the week. A small chance for precipitation lingers Tuesday mostly in the east, otherwise, dry conditions, seasonable temperatures, and low humidity’s can be expected.  Clouds and precipitation will keep Ozone Good Monday. Good levels continue Tuesday into Wednesday thanks to northwesterly winds and cooler surface and upper level temperatures. Temperatures will warm at the surface each day past mid-week, but upper level readings remain low through Friday. Ozone could reach Moderate in a few locations, but mostly Good levels should continue.  Fine particulate could also see slow increases starting Thursday, but readings higher than low-Moderate are not anticipated.  EXTENDED FORECAST:  Extended models keep high pressure over the region through early next week. Remaining under the same airmass for a few days could be a set up for increased pollution. At this time readings higher than Moderate are not expected, but this forecast will be updated Friday to better detail air quality conditions through early next week.

Winds will be from the southwest and sunny skies are expected statewide.  High temperatures will reach the 80s across most of the state. Yellow (moderate) AQI values for ozone are possible for the Twin Cities due to mostly sunny skies and warmer temperatures.  Green (good) AQI values are expected for the rest of the state.  Tomorrow’s weather will be very similar.  Light winds from the south are expected and temperatures will be in the 80s. Scattered clouds are possible in the far northern and far southern parts of the state. Yellow AQI values for ozone are again possible in the Twin Cities. Green AQI values are expected for the rest of the state.  On Saturday, the high pressure center moves further west into Iowa. Winds will remain light over the state, however humidity will increase bringing a few clouds to the eastern half of the state. Yellow AQI values are possible for the Twin Cities and the southeast corner of the state. Air quality should be in the Green category for the rest of the state.  On Sunday, high pressure moves further south and a frontal boundary approaches from the west.  This will produce stronger winds from the southwest.  Air quality in the Yellow category is again possible in the northern Twin Cities suburbs and also the southwest corner of the state.

Therefore there will be a break in the local storm activity over the next few days. The trough poses no impact to the local area as it will weaken and eventually the Monsoon high pressure will migrate westward and build over the area. The afternoon high temperatures will be on the rise and approach 110 degrees by the end of the weekend/early next week.  The ozone levels are forecast to approach and exceed the health standard today and again on Friday due to the favorable conditions for ozone formation (abundant sunshine, hot afternoon temperatures and light winds). Therefore today’s ozone high pollution advisory has been extended into Friday. Anyone with respiratory and/or heart ailments should limit outdoor activities during the afternoon and evening hours when the ozone levels are at their highest.  	There is a slight chance for some outflow winds coming off the mountains to our east on Saturday evening, have dust mentioned but the overall PM10 forecast is still in the good AQI category due to the recent rains.

08/01/19|08/06/19||MST|5|F|N|Casa Grande|AZ|32.8775|-111.8522|PM10|46|Good|No|Updated Thursday, August 1, 2019 ** OZONE HIGH POLLUTION ADVISORY IN EFFECT THURSDAY & FRIDAY, AUGUST 1ST & 2ND **  The Monsoon high has been pushed eastward due to an approaching trough currently located off the Pacific coast. Therefore there will be a break in the local storm activity over the next few days. The trough poses no impact to the local area as it will weaken and eventually the Monsoon high pressure will migrate westward and build over the area. The afternoon high temperatures will be on the rise and approach 110 degrees by the end of the weekend/early next week.  The ozone levels are forecast to approach and exceed the health standard today and again on Friday due to the favorable conditions for ozone formation (abundant sunshine, hot afternoon temperatures and light winds). Therefore today’s ozone high pollution advisory has been extended into Friday. Anyone with respiratory and/or heart ailments should limit outdoor activities during the afternoon and evening hours when the ozone levels are at their highest.  	There is a slight chance for some outflow winds coming off the mountains to our east on Saturday evening, have dust mentioned but the overall PM10 forecast is still in the good AQI category due to the recent rains. Stay tuned and check back on Friday for an updated air quality forecast.

Therefore there will be a break in the local storm activity over the next few days. The trough poses no impact to the local area as it will weaken and eventually the Monsoon high pressure will migrate westward and build over the area. The afternoon high temperatures will be on the rise and approach 110 degrees by the end of the weekend/early next week.  The ozone levels are forecast to approach and exceed the health standard today and again on Friday due to the favorable conditions for ozone formation (abundant sunshine, hot afternoon temperatures and light winds). Therefore today’s ozone high pollution advisory has been extended into Friday. Anyone with respiratory and/or heart ailments should limit outdoor activities during the afternoon and evening hours when the ozone levels are at their highest.  	There is a slight chance for some outflow winds coming off the mountains to our east on Saturday evening, have dust mentioned but the overall PM10 forecast is still in the good AQI category due to the recent rains. Stay tuned and check back on Friday for an updated air quality forecast.

08/01/19|08/01/19||EDT|0|F|Y|Detroit|MI|42.2330|-83.3330|OZONE||Moderate|No|FORECAST SUMMARY: Monday, July 29th, 2019 through Friday, August 2nd, 2019  Ozone: 8-hour Ozone concentrations will be mostly Good through mid-week, then a mix of Good and Moderates are expected.  PM-2.5: 24-hour Fine Particulate concentrations will range from Good to low-Moderate.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  A cold front passing Monday will bring showers and/or storms. High pressure then moves in Tuesday and forecast models have this high positioned over the Great Lakes region through the end of the week. A small chance for precipitation lingers Tuesday mostly in the east, otherwise, dry conditions, seasonable temperatures, and low humidity’s can be expected.  Clouds and precipitation will keep Ozone Good Monday. Good levels continue Tuesday into Wednesday thanks to northwesterly winds and cooler surface and upper level temperatures. Temperatures will warm at the surface each day past mid-week, but upper level readings remain low through Friday. Ozone could reach Moderate in a few locations, but mostly Good levels should continue.  Fine particulate could also see slow increases starting Thursday, but readings higher than low-Moderate are not anticipated.  EXTENDED FORECAST:  Extended models keep high pressure over the region through early next week. Remaining under the same airmass for a few days could be a set up for increased pollution. At this time readings higher than Moderate are not expected, but this forecast will be updated Friday to better detail air quality conditions through early next week.

Winds will be from the southwest and sunny skies are expected statewide.  High temperatures will reach the 80s across most of the state. Yellow (moderate) AQI values for ozone are possible for the Twin Cities due to mostly sunny skies and warmer temperatures.  Green (good) AQI values are expected for the rest of the state.  Tomorrow’s weather will be very similar.  Light winds from the south are expected and temperatures will be in the 80s. Scattered clouds are possible in the far northern and far southern parts of the state. Yellow AQI values for ozone are again possible in the Twin Cities. Green AQI values are expected for the rest of the state.  On Saturday, the high pressure center moves further west into Iowa. Winds will remain light over the state, however humidity will increase bringing a few clouds to the eastern half of the state. Yellow AQI values are possible for the Twin Cities and the southeast corner of the state. Air quality should be in the Green category for the rest of the state.  On Sunday, high pressure moves further south and a frontal boundary approaches from the west.  This will produce stronger winds from the southwest.

PM-2.5: 24-hour Fine Particulate concentrations will range from Good to low-Moderate.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  A cold front passing Monday will bring showers and/or storms. High pressure then moves in Tuesday and forecast models have this high positioned over the Great Lakes region through the end of the week. A small chance for precipitation lingers Tuesday mostly in the east, otherwise, dry conditions, seasonable temperatures, and low humidity’s can be expected.  Clouds and precipitation will keep Ozone Good Monday. Good levels continue Tuesday into Wednesday thanks to northwesterly winds and cooler surface and upper level temperatures. Temperatures will warm at the surface each day past mid-week, but upper level readings remain low through Friday. Ozone could reach Moderate in a few locations, but mostly Good levels should continue.  Fine particulate could also see slow increases starting Thursday, but readings higher than low-Moderate are not anticipated.  EXTENDED FORECAST:  Extended models keep high pressure over the region through early next week. Remaining under the same airmass for a few days could be a set up for increased pollution. At this time readings higher than Moderate are not expected, but this forecast will be updated Friday to better detail air quality conditions through early next week.

Therefore there will be a break in the local storm activity over the next few days. The trough poses no impact to the local area as it will weaken and eventually the Monsoon high pressure will migrate westward and build over the area. The afternoon high temperatures will be on the rise and approach 110 degrees by the end of the weekend/early next week.  The ozone levels are forecast to approach and exceed the health standard today and again on Friday due to the favorable conditions for ozone formation (abundant sunshine, hot afternoon temperatures and light winds). Therefore today’s ozone high pollution advisory has been extended into Friday. Anyone with respiratory and/or heart ailments should limit outdoor activities during the afternoon and evening hours when the ozone levels are at their highest.  	There is a slight chance for some outflow winds coming off the mountains to our east on Saturday evening, have dust mentioned but the overall PM10 forecast is still in the good AQI category due to the recent rains.

08/01/19|08/01/19||EDT|0|F|Y|Flint|MI|43.0146|-83.6959|OZONE||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY: Monday, July 29th, 2019 through Friday, August 2nd, 2019  Ozone: 8-hour Ozone concentrations will be mostly Good through mid-week, then a mix of Good and Moderates are expected.  PM-2.5: 24-hour Fine Particulate concentrations will range from Good to low-Moderate.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  A cold front passing Monday will bring showers and/or storms. High pressure then moves in Tuesday and forecast models have this high positioned over the Great Lakes region through the end of the week. A small chance for precipitation lingers Tuesday mostly in the east, otherwise, dry conditions, seasonable temperatures, and low humidity’s can be expected.  Clouds and precipitation will keep Ozone Good Monday. Good levels continue Tuesday into Wednesday thanks to northwesterly winds and cooler surface and upper level temperatures. Temperatures will warm at the surface each day past mid-week, but upper level readings remain low through Friday. Ozone could reach Moderate in a few locations, but mostly Good levels should continue.  Fine particulate could also see slow increases starting Thursday, but readings higher than low-Moderate are not anticipated.  EXTENDED FORECAST:  Extended models keep high pressure over the region through early next week. Remaining under the same airmass for a few days could be a set up for increased pollution. At this time readings higher than Moderate are not expected, but this forecast will be updated Friday to better detail air quality conditions through early next week.

Winds will be from the southwest and sunny skies are expected statewide.  High temperatures will reach the 80s across most of the state. Yellow (moderate) AQI values for ozone are possible for the Twin Cities due to mostly sunny skies and warmer temperatures.  Green (good) AQI values are expected for the rest of the state.  Tomorrow’s weather will be very similar.  Light winds from the south are expected and temperatures will be in the 80s. Scattered clouds are possible in the far northern and far southern parts of the state. Yellow AQI values for ozone are again possible in the Twin Cities. Green AQI values are expected for the rest of the state.  On Saturday, the high pressure center moves further west into Iowa. Winds will remain light over the state, however humidity will increase bringing a few clouds to the eastern half of the state. Yellow AQI values are possible for the Twin Cities and the southeast corner of the state. Air quality should be in the Green category for the rest of the state.  On Sunday, high pressure moves further south and a frontal boundary approaches from the west.  This will produce stronger winds from the southwest.

Winds will be from the southwest and sunny skies are expected statewide.  High temperatures will reach the 80s across most of the state. Yellow (moderate) AQI values for ozone are possible for the Twin Cities due to mostly sunny skies and warmer temperatures.  Green (good) AQI values are expected for the rest of the state.  Tomorrow’s weather will be very similar.  Light winds from the south are expected and temperatures will be in the 80s. Scattered clouds are possible in the far northern and far southern parts of the state. Yellow AQI values for ozone are again possible in the Twin Cities. Green AQI values are expected for the rest of the state.  On Saturday, the high pressure center moves further west into Iowa. Winds will remain light over the state, however humidity will increase bringing a few clouds to the eastern half of the state. Yellow AQI values are possible for the Twin Cities and the southeast corner of the state. Air quality should be in the Green category for the rest of the state.  On Sunday, high pressure moves further south and a frontal boundary approaches from the west.  This will produce stronger winds from the southwest.  Air quality in the Yellow category is again possible in the northern Twin Cities suburbs and also the southwest corner of the state.

Winds will remain light over the state, however humidity will increase bringing a few clouds to the eastern half of the state. Yellow AQI values are possible for the Twin Cities and the southeast corner of the state. Air quality should be in the Green category for the rest of the state.  On Sunday, high pressure moves further south and a frontal boundary approaches from the west.  This will produce stronger winds from the southwest.  Air quality in the Yellow category is again possible in the northern Twin Cities suburbs and also the southwest corner of the state.  The rest of the state can expect Green AQI values.|Minnesota Pollution Control Agency

08/01/19|08/01/19||EDT|0|F|Y|Grand Rapids|MI|42.8330|-85.5170|OZONE||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY: Monday, July 29th, 2019 through Friday, August 2nd, 2019  Ozone: 8-hour Ozone concentrations will be mostly Good through mid-week, then a mix of Good and Moderates are expected.  PM-2.5: 24-hour Fine Particulate concentrations will range from Good to low-Moderate.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  A cold front passing Monday will bring showers and/or storms. High pressure then moves in Tuesday and forecast models have this high positioned over the Great Lakes region through the end of the week. A small chance for precipitation lingers Tuesday mostly in the east, otherwise, dry conditions, seasonable temperatures, and low humidity’s can be expected.  Clouds and precipitation will keep Ozone Good Monday. Good levels continue Tuesday into Wednesday thanks to northwesterly winds and cooler surface and upper level temperatures. Temperatures will warm at the surface each day past mid-week, but upper level readings remain low through Friday. Ozone could reach Moderate in a few locations, but mostly Good levels should continue.  Fine particulate could also see slow increases starting Thursday, but readings higher than low-Moderate are not anticipated.  EXTENDED FORECAST:  Extended models keep high pressure over the region through early next week. Remaining under the same airmass for a few days could be a set up for increased pollution. At this time readings higher than Moderate are not expected, but this forecast will be updated Friday to better detail air quality conditions through early next week.

Therefore there will be a break in the local storm activity over the next few days. The trough poses no impact to the local area as it will weaken and eventually the Monsoon high pressure will migrate westward and build over the area. The afternoon high temperatures will be on the rise and approach 110 degrees by the end of the weekend/early next week.  The ozone levels are forecast to approach and exceed the health standard today and again on Friday due to the favorable conditions for ozone formation (abundant sunshine, hot afternoon temperatures and light winds). Therefore today’s ozone high pollution advisory has been extended into Friday. Anyone with respiratory and/or heart ailments should limit outdoor activities during the afternoon and evening hours when the ozone levels are at their highest.  	There is a slight chance for some outflow winds coming off the mountains to our east on Saturday evening, have dust mentioned but the overall PM10 forecast is still in the good AQI category due to the recent rains. Stay tuned and check back on Friday for an updated air quality forecast.

08/01/19|08/01/19||EDT|0|F|Y|Houghton Lake|MI|44.3147|-84.7647|OZONE||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY: Monday, July 29th, 2019 through Friday, August 2nd, 2019  Ozone: 8-hour Ozone concentrations will be mostly Good through mid-week, then a mix of Good and Moderates are expected.  PM-2.5: 24-hour Fine Particulate concentrations will range from Good to low-Moderate.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  A cold front passing Monday will bring showers and/or storms. High pressure then moves in Tuesday and forecast models have this high positioned over the Great Lakes region through the end of the week. A small chance for precipitation lingers Tuesday mostly in the east, otherwise, dry conditions, seasonable temperatures, and low humidity’s can be expected.  Clouds and precipitation will keep Ozone Good Monday. Good levels continue Tuesday into Wednesday thanks to northwesterly winds and cooler surface and upper level temperatures. Temperatures will warm at the surface each day past mid-week, but upper level readings remain low through Friday. Ozone could reach Moderate in a few locations, but mostly Good levels should continue.  Fine particulate could also see slow increases starting Thursday, but readings higher than low-Moderate are not anticipated.  EXTENDED FORECAST:  Extended models keep high pressure over the region through early next week. Remaining under the same airmass for a few days could be a set up for increased pollution. At this time readings higher than Moderate are not expected, but this forecast will be updated Friday to better detail air quality conditions through early next week.

08/01/19|08/01/19||EDT|0|F|Y|Kalamazoo|MI|42.2747|-85.5883|OZONE||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY: Monday, July 29th, 2019 through Friday, August 2nd, 2019  Ozone: 8-hour Ozone concentrations will be mostly Good through mid-week, then a mix of Good and Moderates are expected.  PM-2.5: 24-hour Fine Particulate concentrations will range from Good to low-Moderate.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  A cold front passing Monday will bring showers and/or storms. High pressure then moves in Tuesday and forecast models have this high positioned over the Great Lakes region through the end of the week. A small chance for precipitation lingers Tuesday mostly in the east, otherwise, dry conditions, seasonable temperatures, and low humidity’s can be expected.  Clouds and precipitation will keep Ozone Good Monday. Good levels continue Tuesday into Wednesday thanks to northwesterly winds and cooler surface and upper level temperatures. Temperatures will warm at the surface each day past mid-week, but upper level readings remain low through Friday. Ozone could reach Moderate in a few locations, but mostly Good levels should continue.  Fine particulate could also see slow increases starting Thursday, but readings higher than low-Moderate are not anticipated.  EXTENDED FORECAST:  Extended models keep high pressure over the region through early next week. Remaining under the same airmass for a few days could be a set up for increased pollution. At this time readings higher than Moderate are not expected, but this forecast will be updated Friday to better detail air quality conditions through early next week.

08/01/19|08/01/19||EDT|0|F|Y|Lansing|MI|42.7408|-84.5447|OZONE||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY: Monday, July 29th, 2019 through Friday, August 2nd, 2019  Ozone: 8-hour Ozone concentrations will be mostly Good through mid-week, then a mix of Good and Moderates are expected.  PM-2.5: 24-hour Fine Particulate concentrations will range from Good to low-Moderate.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  A cold front passing Monday will bring showers and/or storms. High pressure then moves in Tuesday and forecast models have this high positioned over the Great Lakes region through the end of the week. A small chance for precipitation lingers Tuesday mostly in the east, otherwise, dry conditions, seasonable temperatures, and low humidity’s can be expected.  Clouds and precipitation will keep Ozone Good Monday. Good levels continue Tuesday into Wednesday thanks to northwesterly winds and cooler surface and upper level temperatures. Temperatures will warm at the surface each day past mid-week, but upper level readings remain low through Friday. Ozone could reach Moderate in a few locations, but mostly Good levels should continue.  Fine particulate could also see slow increases starting Thursday, but readings higher than low-Moderate are not anticipated.  EXTENDED FORECAST:  Extended models keep high pressure over the region through early next week. Remaining under the same airmass for a few days could be a set up for increased pollution. At this time readings higher than Moderate are not expected, but this forecast will be updated Friday to better detail air quality conditions through early next week.

08/01/19|08/01/19||EDT|0|F|Y|Ludington|MI|43.9553|-86.4525|OZONE||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY: Monday, July 29th, 2019 through Friday, August 2nd, 2019  Ozone: 8-hour Ozone concentrations will be mostly Good through mid-week, then a mix of Good and Moderates are expected.  PM-2.5: 24-hour Fine Particulate concentrations will range from Good to low-Moderate.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  A cold front passing Monday will bring showers and/or storms. High pressure then moves in Tuesday and forecast models have this high positioned over the Great Lakes region through the end of the week. A small chance for precipitation lingers Tuesday mostly in the east, otherwise, dry conditions, seasonable temperatures, and low humidity’s can be expected.  Clouds and precipitation will keep Ozone Good Monday. Good levels continue Tuesday into Wednesday thanks to northwesterly winds and cooler surface and upper level temperatures. Temperatures will warm at the surface each day past mid-week, but upper level readings remain low through Friday. Ozone could reach Moderate in a few locations, but mostly Good levels should continue.  Fine particulate could also see slow increases starting Thursday, but readings higher than low-Moderate are not anticipated.  EXTENDED FORECAST:  Extended models keep high pressure over the region through early next week. Remaining under the same airmass for a few days could be a set up for increased pollution. At this time readings higher than Moderate are not expected, but this forecast will be updated Friday to better detail air quality conditions through early next week.

High pressure then moves in Tuesday and forecast models have this high positioned over the Great Lakes region through the end of the week. A small chance for precipitation lingers Tuesday mostly in the east, otherwise, dry conditions, seasonable temperatures, and low humidity’s can be expected.  Clouds and precipitation will keep Ozone Good Monday. Good levels continue Tuesday into Wednesday thanks to northwesterly winds and cooler surface and upper level temperatures. Temperatures will warm at the surface each day past mid-week, but upper level readings remain low through Friday. Ozone could reach Moderate in a few locations, but mostly Good levels should continue.  Fine particulate could also see slow increases starting Thursday, but readings higher than low-Moderate are not anticipated.  EXTENDED FORECAST:  Extended models keep high pressure over the region through early next week. Remaining under the same airmass for a few days could be a set up for increased pollution. At this time readings higher than Moderate are not expected, but this forecast will be updated Friday to better detail air quality conditions through early next week.  Forecast updated by Stephanie Hengesbach: Monday, July 29th, 2019  Next forecast update: Friday, August 2nd, 2019|Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy

Winds will be from the southwest and sunny skies are expected statewide.  High temperatures will reach the 80s across most of the state. Yellow (moderate) AQI values for ozone are possible for the Twin Cities due to mostly sunny skies and warmer temperatures.  Green (good) AQI values are expected for the rest of the state.  Tomorrow’s weather will be very similar.  Light winds from the south are expected and temperatures will be in the 80s. Scattered clouds are possible in the far northern and far southern parts of the state. Yellow AQI values for ozone are again possible in the Twin Cities. Green AQI values are expected for the rest of the state.  On Saturday, the high pressure center moves further west into Iowa. Winds will remain light over the state, however humidity will increase bringing a few clouds to the eastern half of the state. Yellow AQI values are possible for the Twin Cities and the southeast corner of the state. Air quality should be in the Green category for the rest of the state.  On Sunday, high pressure moves further south and a frontal boundary approaches from the west.  This will produce stronger winds from the southwest.  Air quality in the Yellow category is again possible in the northern Twin Cities suburbs and also the southwest corner of the state.

Therefore there will be a break in the local storm activity over the next few days. The trough poses no impact to the local area as it will weaken and eventually the Monsoon high pressure will migrate westward and build over the area. The afternoon high temperatures will be on the rise and approach 110 degrees by the end of the weekend/early next week.  The ozone levels are forecast to approach and exceed the health standard today and again on Friday due to the favorable conditions for ozone formation (abundant sunshine, hot afternoon temperatures and light winds). Therefore today’s ozone high pollution advisory has been extended into Friday. Anyone with respiratory and/or heart ailments should limit outdoor activities during the afternoon and evening hours when the ozone levels are at their highest.  	There is a slight chance for some outflow winds coming off the mountains to our east on Saturday evening, have dust mentioned but the overall PM10 forecast is still in the good AQI category due to the recent rains.

Therefore there will be a break in the local storm activity over the next few days. The trough poses no impact to the local area as it will weaken and eventually the Monsoon high pressure will migrate westward and build over the area. The afternoon high temperatures will be on the rise and approach 110 degrees by the end of the weekend/early next week.  The ozone levels are forecast to approach and exceed the health standard today and again on Friday due to the favorable conditions for ozone formation (abundant sunshine, hot afternoon temperatures and light winds). Therefore today’s ozone high pollution advisory has been extended into Friday. Anyone with respiratory and/or heart ailments should limit outdoor activities during the afternoon and evening hours when the ozone levels are at their highest.  	There is a slight chance for some outflow winds coming off the mountains to our east on Saturday evening, have dust mentioned but the overall PM10 forecast is still in the good AQI category due to the recent rains.

Winds will be from the southwest and sunny skies are expected statewide.  High temperatures will reach the 80s across most of the state. Yellow (moderate) AQI values for ozone are possible for the Twin Cities due to mostly sunny skies and warmer temperatures.  Green (good) AQI values are expected for the rest of the state.  Tomorrow’s weather will be very similar.  Light winds from the south are expected and temperatures will be in the 80s. Scattered clouds are possible in the far northern and far southern parts of the state. Yellow AQI values for ozone are again possible in the Twin Cities. Green AQI values are expected for the rest of the state.  On Saturday, the high pressure center moves further west into Iowa. Winds will remain light over the state, however humidity will increase bringing a few clouds to the eastern half of the state. Yellow AQI values are possible for the Twin Cities and the southeast corner of the state. Air quality should be in the Green category for the rest of the state.  On Sunday, high pressure moves further south and a frontal boundary approaches from the west.  This will produce stronger winds from the southwest.

08/01/19|08/01/19||EDT|0|F|Y|Saginaw|MI|43.4196|-83.9495|OZONE||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY: Monday, July 29th, 2019 through Friday, August 2nd, 2019  Ozone: 8-hour Ozone concentrations will be mostly Good through mid-week, then a mix of Good and Moderates are expected.  PM-2.5: 24-hour Fine Particulate concentrations will range from Good to low-Moderate.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  A cold front passing Monday will bring showers and/or storms. High pressure then moves in Tuesday and forecast models have this high positioned over the Great Lakes region through the end of the week. A small chance for precipitation lingers Tuesday mostly in the east, otherwise, dry conditions, seasonable temperatures, and low humidity’s can be expected.  Clouds and precipitation will keep Ozone Good Monday. Good levels continue Tuesday into Wednesday thanks to northwesterly winds and cooler surface and upper level temperatures. Temperatures will warm at the surface each day past mid-week, but upper level readings remain low through Friday. Ozone could reach Moderate in a few locations, but mostly Good levels should continue.  Fine particulate could also see slow increases starting Thursday, but readings higher than low-Moderate are not anticipated.  EXTENDED FORECAST:  Extended models keep high pressure over the region through early next week. Remaining under the same airmass for a few days could be a set up for increased pollution. At this time readings higher than Moderate are not expected, but this forecast will be updated Friday to better detail air quality conditions through early next week.

Ozone could reach Moderate in a few locations, but mostly Good levels should continue.  Fine particulate could also see slow increases starting Thursday, but readings higher than low-Moderate are not anticipated.  EXTENDED FORECAST:  Extended models keep high pressure over the region through early next week. Remaining under the same airmass for a few days could be a set up for increased pollution. At this time readings higher than Moderate are not expected, but this forecast will be updated Friday to better detail air quality conditions through early next week.

Therefore there will be a break in the local storm activity over the next few days. The trough poses no impact to the local area as it will weaken and eventually the Monsoon high pressure will migrate westward and build over the area. The afternoon high temperatures will be on the rise and approach 110 degrees by the end of the weekend/early next week.  The ozone levels are forecast to approach and exceed the health standard today and again on Friday due to the favorable conditions for ozone formation (abundant sunshine, hot afternoon temperatures and light winds). Therefore today’s ozone high pollution advisory has been extended into Friday. Anyone with respiratory and/or heart ailments should limit outdoor activities during the afternoon and evening hours when the ozone levels are at their highest.  	There is a slight chance for some outflow winds coming off the mountains to our east on Saturday evening, have dust mentioned but the overall PM10 forecast is still in the good AQI category due to the recent rains. Stay tuned and check back on Friday for an updated air quality forecast.

There is a slight chance for some outflow winds coming off the mountains to our east on Saturday evening, have dust mentioned but the overall PM10 forecast is still in the good AQI category due to the recent rains. Stay tuned and check back on Friday for an updated air quality forecast.

Therefore there will be a break in the local storm activity over the next few days. The trough poses no impact to the local area as it will weaken and eventually the Monsoon high pressure will migrate westward and build over the area. The afternoon high temperatures will be on the rise and approach 110 degrees by the end of the weekend/early next week.  The ozone levels are forecast to approach and exceed the health standard today and again on Friday due to the favorable conditions for ozone formation (abundant sunshine, hot afternoon temperatures and light winds). Therefore today’s ozone high pollution advisory has been extended into Friday. Anyone with respiratory and/or heart ailments should limit outdoor activities during the afternoon and evening hours when the ozone levels are at their highest.  	There is a slight chance for some outflow winds coming off the mountains to our east on Saturday evening, have dust mentioned but the overall PM10 forecast is still in the good AQI category due to the recent rains.

Therefore there will be a break in the local storm activity over the next few days. The trough poses no impact to the local area as it will weaken and eventually the Monsoon high pressure will migrate westward and build over the area. The afternoon high temperatures will be on the rise and approach 110 degrees by the end of the weekend/early next week.  The ozone levels are forecast to approach and exceed the health standard today and again on Friday due to the favorable conditions for ozone formation (abundant sunshine, hot afternoon temperatures and light winds). Therefore today’s ozone high pollution advisory has been extended into Friday. Anyone with respiratory and/or heart ailments should limit outdoor activities during the afternoon and evening hours when the ozone levels are at their highest.  	There is a slight chance for some outflow winds coming off the mountains to our east on Saturday evening, have dust mentioned but the overall PM10 forecast is still in the good AQI category due to the recent rains. Stay tuned and check back on Friday for an updated air quality forecast.

Therefore there will be a break in the local storm activity over the next few days. The trough poses no impact to the local area as it will weaken and eventually the Monsoon high pressure will migrate westward and build over the area. The afternoon high temperatures will be on the rise and approach 110 degrees by the end of the weekend/early next week.  The ozone levels are forecast to approach and exceed the health standard today and again on Friday due to the favorable conditions for ozone formation (abundant sunshine, hot afternoon temperatures and light winds). Therefore today’s ozone high pollution advisory has been extended into Friday. Anyone with respiratory and/or heart ailments should limit outdoor activities during the afternoon and evening hours when the ozone levels are at their highest.

08/01/19|08/01/19||EDT|0|F|Y|Traverse City|MI|44.7544|-85.6029|OZONE||Good|No|FORECAST SUMMARY: Monday, July 29th, 2019 through Friday, August 2nd, 2019  Ozone: 8-hour Ozone concentrations will be mostly Good through mid-week, then a mix of Good and Moderates are expected.  PM-2.5: 24-hour Fine Particulate concentrations will range from Good to low-Moderate.  FORECAST DISCUSSION:  A cold front passing Monday will bring showers and/or storms. High pressure then moves in Tuesday and forecast models have this high positioned over the Great Lakes region through the end of the week. A small chance for precipitation lingers Tuesday mostly in the east, otherwise, dry conditions, seasonable temperatures, and low humidity’s can be expected.  Clouds and precipitation will keep Ozone Good Monday. Good levels continue Tuesday into Wednesday thanks to northwesterly winds and cooler surface and upper level temperatures. Temperatures will warm at the surface each day past mid-week, but upper level readings remain low through Friday. Ozone could reach Moderate in a few locations, but mostly Good levels should continue.  Fine particulate could also see slow increases starting Thursday, but readings higher than low-Moderate are not anticipated.  EXTENDED FORECAST:  Extended models keep high pressure over the region through early next week. Remaining under the same airmass for a few days could be a set up for increased pollution. At this time readings higher than Moderate are not expected, but this forecast will be updated Friday to better detail air quality conditions through early next week.

Strong thunderstorms with heavy rain moved through the region during the afternoon dropping up to an inch of rain in spots. The largest rain total was found at a gauge near Houghton Road and E 22nd St, coming in at 1.13". Officially, Tucson International Airport measured 0.37" and Davis-Monthan recorded 0.91". <br/><br/>For today, the monsoon high is centered over the Texas panhandle which means rather light south-southwest steering flow for storms. With that said, there is still plenty of moisture and enough surface heating for at least a slight chance of thunderstorms today. Am not expecting the same storm coverage that was seen yesterday, but any storms that do form will be capable of producing very heavy rain. <br/><br/>This weekend into the first part of next week, the monsoon high will shift back toward the west; however, moisture is forecast to be limited, and steering flow will continue to be weak. This all means storms will struggle to make it off the higher terrain into the Valley. Still, have a slight chance of storms each afternoon, but only isolated storms are in the forecast. <br/><br/>As for air quality, with weak winds, ozone will be on the rise. Currently, not thinking ozone will reach the federal health standard, but values are forecast to be in the mid-Moderate AQI category through the weekend.

Strong thunderstorms with heavy rain moved through the region during the afternoon dropping up to an inch of rain in spots. The largest rain total was found at a gauge near Houghton Road and E 22nd St, coming in at 1.13". Officially, Tucson International Airport measured 0.37" and Davis-Monthan recorded 0.91". <br/><br/>For today, the monsoon high is centered over the Texas panhandle which means rather light south-southwest steering flow for storms. With that said, there is still plenty of moisture and enough surface heating for at least a slight chance of thunderstorms today. Am not expecting the same storm coverage that was seen yesterday, but any storms that do form will be capable of producing very heavy rain. <br/><br/>This weekend into the first part of next week, the monsoon high will shift back toward the west; however, moisture is forecast to be limited, and steering flow will continue to be weak. This all means storms will struggle to make it off the higher terrain into the Valley. Still, have a slight chance of storms each afternoon, but only isolated storms are in the forecast. <br/><br/>As for air quality, with weak winds, ozone will be on the rise. Currently, not thinking ozone will reach the federal health standard, but values are forecast to be in the mid-Moderate AQI category through the weekend.

Winds will be from the southwest and sunny skies are expected statewide.  High temperatures will reach the 80s across most of the state. Yellow (moderate) AQI values for ozone are possible for the Twin Cities due to mostly sunny skies and warmer temperatures.  Green (good) AQI values are expected for the rest of the state.  Tomorrow’s weather will be very similar.  Light winds from the south are expected and temperatures will be in the 80s. Scattered clouds are possible in the far northern and far southern parts of the state. Yellow AQI values for ozone are again possible in the Twin Cities. Green AQI values are expected for the rest of the state.  On Saturday, the high pressure center moves further west into Iowa. Winds will remain light over the state, however humidity will increase bringing a few clouds to the eastern half of the state. Yellow AQI values are possible for the Twin Cities and the southeast corner of the state. Air quality should be in the Green category for the rest of the state.  On Sunday, high pressure moves further south and a frontal boundary approaches from the west.  This will produce stronger winds from the southwest.  Air quality in the Yellow category is again possible in the northern Twin Cities suburbs and also the southwest corner of the state.

This will allow local emissions to build.  However, unsettled conditions and cloud cover will likely mitigate any significant pollution concerns.  On Friday, unsettled conditions and cloud cover will keep ozone in check.  A few areas with peaks of sun may see ozone rise briefly before unsettled conditions mitigate any rise.  Mostly Good air quality is expected regionally.  On Saturday, scattered unsettled weather and light southeasterly flow will be enough to keep Good air quality in the forecast.

Tomorrow’s weather will be very similar.  Light winds from the south are expected and temperatures will be in the 80s. Scattered clouds are possible in the far northern and far southern parts of the state. Yellow AQI values for ozone are again possible in the Twin Cities. Green AQI values are expected for the rest of the state.  On Saturday, the high pressure center moves further west into Iowa. Winds will remain light over the state, however humidity will increase bringing a few clouds to the eastern half of the state. Yellow AQI values are possible for the Twin Cities and the southeast corner of the state. Air quality should be in the Green category for the rest of the state.  On Sunday, high pressure moves further south and a frontal boundary approaches from the west.  This will produce stronger winds from the southwest.  Air quality in the Yellow category is again possible in the northern Twin Cities suburbs and also the southwest corner of the state.  The rest of the state can expect Green AQI values.|Minnesota Pollution Control Agency

However, increasing sunshine will enhance ozone formation. As a result, AQI levels will be high-Good.   Friday, August 2 and Saturday, August 3: Surface high pressure over the Great Lakes will produce continued light north-northeasterly winds. Although these winds will gradually transport clean air into the region, low wind speeds will limit pollutant dispersion in the Mahoning Valley. In addition, mostly sunny skies and warm temperatures will enhance ozone formation. Therefore, AQI levels will be Moderate on both days.   Sunday, northerly winds will strengthen, dispersing pollutants and lowering AQI levels to low-Moderate. Monday, calm to light winds will reduce mixing and dispersion, allowing pollutants to accumulate in Youngstown-Warren. Furthermore, mostly sunny skies will continue to support ozone formation. As a result, AQI levels will be Moderate. Tuesday, west-southwesterly winds will develop ahead of an approaching cold front, bringing regional pollutants into the Mahoning Valley.
